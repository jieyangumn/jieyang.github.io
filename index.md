## About Me

I have rich experience in developing machine/deep learning models and interpreting model responses in the face of uncertainties inherent to agricultural systems. My research involves the development of advanced modeling approaches to investigate subjects concerning sustainable agricultural production under conditions of climate change.

## Professional Training

- **2023-present:** Postdoc, University of Minnesota Twin Cities
- **2018-2023:** Ph.D, Zhejiang University
- **2014-2018:** B.E., Huazhong Agricultural University

## News

- **[Jue. 2024]** Our paper on mitigating model uncertainty in fruit quality control using knowledge-guided machine learning has been published in *Postharvest Biology and Technology*.
- **[Feb. 2024]** Our paper on predicting temperature and streamflow within large-scale stream networks using fairness-preserving graph-based neural network has been accepted by *AAAI-2024*.
